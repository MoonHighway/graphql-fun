# GraphQL Fun

The arrival of [GraphQL](http://www.graphql.org) marks a tectonic shift in the way that APIs are designed and will be designed for many years to come. It's useful to talk about all of GraphQL's serious implications for how we fetch data in our applications, but let's not forget that GraphQL is really fun.

This app demonstrates the core concepts of GraphQL with two fun, interactive activities:

TODO: Extend Example Apps

- **Color Groups**: Break up an audience of any size into different groups, assigning each person a color. ðŸŽ¨
- **WeJay**: Pick audience members at random to play a song together. ðŸŽ¹
